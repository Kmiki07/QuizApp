This project is a React + TypeScript quiz app scaffolded with Vite. The app should allow users to select a subject from a menu, and each subject can have quizzes of two types: (1) single-answer multiple choice, (2) flashcard (text or image on one side, text on the other).

When adding styles to element, try to modify the css file mainly, and only reference the styles for the elements.
